## How it Works ?
The plugin allows users to upload a file and select a chart type from a dropdown menu. When the user clicks the "Run" button, it reads the uploaded file's content and the selected chart type using JavaScript. Then, it sends this data to a parent frame and generate the requested chart based on the uploaded file's data and the selected chart type is displayed in figma.
